### Introduction
Hi, I'm Daniel. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, currently pursuing two specializations: Medical Artificial Intelligence and Neural Engineering.

I'm interested in the design, development, and deployment of medical technology and software, especially that which involves machine learning and/or neuroscience applications.

I like to develop software, tools, and games as both a hobby and part of my education and professional journey.

### Projects
- **[EEG Emotional Classification Model](https://github.com/danielszelep/eeg-emotion-classification)** - An EEG emotion classification model, written with Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Uses an RNN built and trained with PyTorch.
- **[Melanoma Detection Model](https://github.com/danielszelep/melanoma-detection-model)** - A melanoma skin cancer detection model that employs a CNN, written with Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Created as part of a final report at Kyoto University.
